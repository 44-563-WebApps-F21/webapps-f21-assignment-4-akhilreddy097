    <h3>A Woman of No Importance</h3>
    <h5>Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s.Large open French window at back,
        looking on to garden
    </h5>
    <p>
        LORD ILLINGWORTH:<br>
        Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you and me now,
        so some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three. I
        assure you, he will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers.<br>
        <br>

        MRS. ARBUTHNOT:<br>
        My son may come in at any moment. I saved you last
        night. I may not be able to save you again. My son feels my dishonour
        strongly, terribly strongly. I beg you to go.<br>
        <br>

        LORD ILLINGWORTH:<br>
        [_Sitting down_.] Last night was excessively
        unfortunate. That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I
        wanted to kiss her. What harm is there in a kiss?<br>
        <br>

        MRS. ARBUTHNOT:<br>
        [_Turning round_.] A kiss may ruin a human life, George
        Harford. _I_ know that. _I_ know that too well.<br>
        <br>

        LORD ILLINGWORTH:<br>
        We won’t discuss that at present. What is of
        importance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son. I am extremely fond
        of him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired his
        conduct last night immensely. He took up the cudgels for that pretty
        prude with wonderful promptitude. He is just what I should have liked a
        son of mine to be. Except that no son of mine should ever take the side
        of the Puritans: that is always an error. Now, what I propose is this.<br>
        <br>

        MRS. ARBUTHNOT:<br>
        Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me.<br>
        <br>

        LORD ILLINGWORTH:<br>
        According to our ridiculous English laws, I can’t
        legitimise Gerald. But I can leave him my property. Illingworth is
        entailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a place. He can have
        Ashby, which is much prettier, Harborough, which has the best shooting in
        the north of England, and the house in St. James Square. What more can a
        gentleman require in this world?<br>
        <br>

        MRS. ARBUTHNOT:<br>
        Nothing more, I am quite sure.<br>
        <br>

        LORD ILLINGWORTH:<br>
        As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in
        these democratic days. As George Harford I had everything I wanted. Now
        I have merely everything that other people want, which isn’t nearly so
        pleasant. Well, my proposal is this<br>
        <br>
