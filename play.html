    <h3>A Woman of No Importance</h3>
    <h5>Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s.Large open French window at back,
        looking on to garden

        <h5>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h5><br><span href="#" class="ico"></span>

        <p class="speech">
            Gerald knows everything about you and me now,
            so some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three. I
            assure you, 
            <br> will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers</p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>ARBUTHNOT</h5> <span href="#" class="ico"></span>
        <p class="speech">My son may come in at any moment. I saved you last
            night. I may not be able to save you again. My son feels my dishonour
            strongly, terribly strongly. I beg you to go</p><br>
        

        <h5>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h5>
        <p class="speech">My son may come in at any moment. I saved you last
            night. I may not be able to save you again. My son feels my dishonour
            strongly, terribly strongly. I beg you to go</p>
            <p class ="stage-direction">[_Sitting down_.]></p> 
        <br>

        <h5>ARBUTHNOT</h5> 
        <p>A kiss may ruin a human life, George
            Harford. _I_ know that. _I_ know that too well</p>
            <p class="stage-direction">[_Turning round_.]</p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h5> <br>
       <p class="speech">We won’t discuss that at present. What is of
        importance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son. I am extremely fond
        of him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired his
        conduct last night immensely. He took up the cudgels for that pretty
        prude with wonderful promptitude. He is just what I should have liked a
        son of mine to be. Except that no son of mine should ever take the side
        of the Puritans: that is always an error. Now, what I propose is this</p> <br>
        <br>

        <h5>ARBUTHNOT</h5> <br>
        <p class="speech">Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me</p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h5> <br>
        <p class="speech">According to our ridiculous English laws, I can’t
            legitimise Gerald. But I can leave him my property. Illingworth is
            entailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a place. He can have
            Ashby, which is much prettier, Harborough, which has the best shooting in
            the north of England, and the house in St. James Square. What more can a
            gentleman require in this world?</p><br>
        

        <h5>ARBUTHNOT</h5> <br>
        <p class="speech">Nothing more, I am quite sure.</p><br>
        <br>

        <h5>LORD ILLINGWORTH</h5> <br>
        <p class="speech">As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in
            these democratic days. As George Harford I had everything I wanted. Now
            I have merely everything that other people want, which isn’t nearly so
            pleasant. Well, my proposal is this</p><br>
